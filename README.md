Another International US keyboard layout with AltGr dead keys for Windows,
made with [MSKLC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) in 2017 at [nanohub.tk](http://nanohub.tk).

This layout is inspired by Linux/Xorg "USA International (AltGr dead keys)" which I use for Portuguese diacritics in US/ANSI keyboards.
